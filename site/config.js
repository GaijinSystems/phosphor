#   {owner}     the first word of name: below (letters and digits, up to 8, lower case)
#   {email}     email: below
#   {hostname}  hostname: if set here, else the first part of the page's address, else {owner}
#   {site}      the address the page was served from (not set here); {hostname} from a file
#   {year}      the connected machine's year, from machines/machines.js (not set here)

# The machine behind the glass, and which others the connect command offers (see
# machines/machines.js). Unset: the first one, and all of them. One machine: no connect.
# machine: random picks one of them for each browser tab (the C128 sits out the draw).
# machine:  v7
# machines: v7

# Your name. The first word (up to 8 letters) is the owner's login, shown in ls -l,
# who and on the mail. {owner} in any section's text becomes that word.
name:      operator

# Your address, for the letter. {email} in any section's text becomes this.

# yes = everything in capitals, like an uppercase-only teletype. Without this line: yes.
uppercase: no

# on = keyclicks from the first tap or keypress; off = silent until "sound on".

# Visitors can switch with the effects command.
